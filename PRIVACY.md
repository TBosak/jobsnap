# JobSnap Privacy Policy
**Last updated:** November 2, 2025

JobSnap respects your privacy. This extension is designed to operate entirely on your local machine — your data never leaves your browser.

## 1. Information We Collect
JobSnap may store the following information **locally on your device**:

- Job descriptions and related notes you save
- Resume and profile information (if provided)
- Autofill history and job application status updates
- Collections, tags, and skill analysis results
- Local preferences (theme, settings, etc.)

All of this data is processed **within your browser** using local technologies such as IndexedDB, Local Storage, and the Chrome extension storage API.  
**No data is transmitted to external servers, APIs, or third parties.**

## 2. How Your Data Is Used
Your data is used solely to power the extension’s features, including:

- Auto-filling job applications
- Saving and organizing job listings
- Tracking application history and statuses
- Performing local AI-powered analysis (via on-device models such as Transformers.js)

All analysis and storage remain local to your browser environment.

## 3. Data Sharing and Transmission
JobSnap does **not**:

- Send, share, or sell your data to anyone
- Use any form of analytics or tracking
- Connect to remote servers or cloud services

Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it.

## 4. User Control and Data Deletion
You have full control over your data:

- You can delete specific saved jobs, history, or collections from within the extension.
- You can clear all stored data at any time by removing the extension or clearing its storage through Chrome’s extension settings.
- You can export and back up your data manually if desired.

---

## 5. Permissions
JobSnap only requests the minimum permissions necessary to:

- Access the current page’s DOM when you choose to autofill or save a job description
- Store data locally using Chrome’s storage APIs

It does not read or modify content on unrelated websites without user action.
